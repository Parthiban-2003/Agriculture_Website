In 2007, the Ministry of Agriculture launched the "FASAL" program, which was based on the knowledge gained through the CAPE project. Agriculture is the foundation of any country's economy. As a result, it is critical to monitor crop growth status and forecast crop output regularly. Crop mapping that is precise and sensible, planting area statistics, and growth status monitoring are all requirements for good agricultural management and policy-making.

Crop mapping  that  is  precise  and  sensible, planting  area statistics, and  growth status monitoring  are all  requirements for  good agricultural management and policy-making.  Crop  yield  estimation  in  various  countries  is  based  on  traditional  data  collection techniques for crop and yield estimation, which include on-the-ground field visits and reports. They are prone to large errors due to insufficient ground observations, which leads to inaccurate crop yield and production estimates. A wide  range of crop growth dynamic information can be obtained in  real-time using  RS.  Crop  acreage  and  yield  prediction  can  be  accomplished  using  RS  data  alone  or  by incorporating RS data into crop growth and development simulation models. At any time, the NDVI is a reliable indicator of  the total green biomass. With the introduction of IRS 1A in 1988, India launched a national level program called Crop Acreage Production Estimation (

                        Predicting crop yields using historical data and machine learning algorithms.Agriculture is the backbone of the Indian economy, accounting for nearly 30% of GDP and employing 70% of the workforce.  Estimating  crop  production  ahead  of  harvest  is  extremely  useful  in  farming  for  purposes  such  as implementing appropriate agricultural management and pricing agricultural commodities for export/import (Doi et al. 2022). Estimating crop production entails calculating the total area under crop and predicting the yield per unit area. Crop acreage and yield estimation are required because they play an important role in the national economy; in planning food  security for  a district/population; in  the country  in  warning decision-makers about potential crop yield reductions; in allowing  timely import and export  decisions; and in assisting private companies in  planning supply chain  decisions such as  production scheduling. The accuracy and speed of  crop yield estimation influence agricultural-economic .
