                <h2>Introduction</h2>
                <p>
                    With the growing adoption of the Internet of Things (IoT), connected devices have penetrated every aspect of our life, from health and fitness, home automation, automotive and logistics, to smart cities and industrial IoT.<br><br>
                    Thus, it is only logical that IoT, connected devices, and automation would find its application in agriculture, and as such, tremendously improve nearly every facet of it. How could one still rely on horses and plows when self-driving cars and virtual reality are no longer a sci-fi fantasy but an everyday occurrence?<br><br>

Farming has seen a number of technological transformations in the last decades, becoming more industrialized and technology-driven. By using various smart agriculture gadgets, farmers have gained better control over the process of raising livestock and growing crops, making it more predictable and improving its efficiency.<br><br>

This, along with the growing consumer demand for agriculture products, has contributed to the increased proliferation of smart farming technologies worldwide. In 2022, the market share for IoT in agriculture reached $13.76 billion.<br><br>

In this article, we will explore the IoT use cases in agriculture and examine their benefits. So, if you are considering investing into smart farming, or are planning to build an IoT solution for agriculture, dive right in.

            <section id="definition">
                <h2>What is smart agriculture?</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many ways to refer to modern agriculture. For example, AgriTech refers to the application of technology in agriculture in general.<br><br>
                    Smart agriculture, on the other hand, is mostly used to denote the application of IoT solutions in agriculture. So what is smart agriculture using IoT? By using IoT sensors to collect environmental and machine metrics, farmers can make informed decisions, and improve just about every aspect of their work â€“ from livestock to crop farming.<br><br>
                    <img src="img/1.jpg" height="300px" width="100%">
For example, by using smart agriculture sensors to monitor the state of crops, farmers can define exactly how many pesticides and fertilizers they have to use to reach optimal efficiency. The same applies to the smart farming definition.<br><br>
Namely, COVID-19 has had a positive impact on IoT in the agriculture market share. Disruptions in the supply chain, and the shortage of qualified workers, has propelled its CAGR to 9,9%. In fact, as per recent reports, the smart framing market share is set to reach $28.56 billion by 2030.<br><br>

At the same time, the global smart agriculture market size is expected to triple by 2025, reaching $15.3 billion (compared to being slightly over $5 billion back in 2016).<br><br>

Because the market is still developing, there is still ample opportunity for businesses willing to join in. Building IoT products for agriculture within the coming years can set you apart as an early adopter, and as such, help you pave the way to success.<br><br>

                <h2>The Benefits of Smart Farming:</h2>
                <p>
                    Technologies and IoT have the potential to transform agriculture in many aspects.

                <h2>IoT Use Cases in Agriculture</h2>
                <p>
                    There are many types of IoT sensors for agriculture as well as IoT applications in agriculture in general:

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2> 1. Monitoring of climate conditions</h2>
                <p>
                    Typically, farmers use manual intervention to control the greenhouse environment. The use of IoT sensors enables them to get accurate real-time information on greenhouse conditions such as lighting, temperature, soil condition, and humidity.<br><br>

                    For instance, Farmapp and Growlink are also IoT agriculture products offering such capabilities among others.

            </section>

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2> 2. Greenhouse automation</h2>
                <p>
                    Probably the most popular smart agriculture gadgets are weather stations, combining various smart farming sensors. Located across the field, they collect various data from the environment and send it to the cloud. The provided measurements can be used to map the climate conditions, choose the appropriate crops, and take the required measures to improve their capacity (i.e. precision farming).<br><br>

                     Some examples of such agriculture IoT devices are allMETEO, Smart Elements, and Pycno.

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2> 3. Crop management</h2>
                <p>
                    One more type of IoT product in agriculture and another element of precision farming are crop management devices. Just like weather stations, they should be placed in the field to collect data specific to crop farming; from temperature and precipitation to leaf water potential and overall crop health.<br><br>

                    hus, you can monitor your crop growth and any anomalies to effectively prevent any diseases or infestations that can harm your yield. Arable and Semios can serve as good representations of how this use case can be applied in real life.

                <h2>1. The hardware</h2>
                <p>
                    To build an IoT solution for agriculture, you need to choose the sensors for your device (or create a custom one). Your choice will depend on the types of information you want to collect and the purpose of your solution in general.<br><br>

                    In any case, the quality of your sensors is crucial to the success of your product: it will depend on the accuracy of the collected data and its reliability.

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2>2. The maintenance</h2>
                <p>
                    Maintenance of your hardware is a challenge that is of primary importance for IoT products in agriculture, as the sensors are typically used in the field and can be easily damaged.<br><br>

Thus, you need to make sure your hardware is durable and easy to maintain. Otherwise you will need to replace your sensors more often than you would like.
                </p>
                
            </section>

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2>3. The mobility</h2>
                <p>
                    Smart farming applications should be tailored for use in the field. A business owner or farm manager should be able to access the information on site or remotely via a smartphone or desktop computer.<br><br>

                    Plus, each connected device should be autonomous and have enough wireless range to communicate with the other devices and send data to the central server.
                </p>
                
            </section>

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2>4. The infrastructure</h2>
                <p>
                    To ensure that your smart farming application performs well (and to make sure it can handle the data load), you need a solid internal infrastructure.<br><br>

                    Furthermore, your internal systems have to be secure. Failing to properly secure your system only increases the likeliness of someone breaking into it, stealing your data or even taking control of your autonomous tractors.
                </p>
                
            </section>

            <section id="use-cases">
                <h2>5. Connectivity</h2>
                <p>
                    The need to transmit data between many agricultural facilities still poses a challenge for the adoption of smart farming. Needless to say, the connection between these facilities should be reliable enough to withstand bad weather conditions and to ensure non-disruptive operations.<br><br>

Today, IoT devices still use varying connection protocols, although the efforts to develop unified standards in this area are currently underway. The advent of 5G and technologies like space-based Internet will, hopefully, help find a solution to this problem.
